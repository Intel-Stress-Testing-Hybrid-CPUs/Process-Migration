   <h2>I3: Capstone Project</h2>
   <p>In recent years there has been a shift in the CPU market for CPU architectures to include both Performance (P) and Efficiency (E) cores. Hybrid compute allows software to optimize its execution across performance and power efficient cores. Our goal is to provide infrastructure for testing process migrations and correct functional output of real world software processes, which requires us to develop a test suite with various tools that can help prove migrating processes between cores correctly works.</p>
